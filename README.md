# Chat-service

Compiled executables for Windows, any CPU, can be found in `Chat-servise.zip`. `ChatServer.exe` takes port number as a command line argument. `ChatConsoleClient.exe` takes server's IPv4 address as a first command line argument and the server's port number as a second argument. Note that `Formats.cs` is the same for the client and the server. 

Happy chatting!
